        The story of the Kingdom of Hallownest can be pieced together through
        dialogue, cutscenes, lore tablets, visual elements, and entries in the Hunter's
        Journal. While there are some ambiguous parts, in general, the information derived
        from these sources can provide a stable foundation for assembling the overall narrative.
        As long as all sources have been exhausted and taken into account, a player should,
        in their own right, have a general understanding of any lore topic.

          The residents of the Hive, below the Kingdom's Edge, are a species of sentient bees. These airborne warriors possess a hive mind which dictates their behaviour among the Hive. Hivelings carry out simple tasks, and can colonise husks to serve the Hive's purpose. Soldiers and Guardians defend the Hive against intruders. Lastly, the flightless but fierce Lifeblood content Hive Knight acts as the last rampart before their monarch, Hive Queen Vespa, who grew so huge she could not leave the Hive. </p>
      <p id="second"> 
        The Hive attacks any intruder who does not wield their blood. They also rejected the Pale King's attempt at perpetuation and separated themselves from the kingdom of Hallownest. Despite their isolation, Vespa's death weakened the Hive, allowing the Infection to spread through. The Infected residents never realised the death of their queen. Their corrupted hive mind dictated to defend her tirelessly, much to the sadness of their queen's spirit.

    <div class="text">
      <p id="first">
          The Flukes are a species of worm-like creatures who took over the Royal Waterways. They stay in the City's sewers for its calm and dampness and don't venture past it. Most of the Flukes encountered are Infected. Like other Infected creatures, they display violent behaviour towards intruders on their territory. </p>
      <p id="second"> 
        Flukes are primitive, but not completely mindless. With the exception of the uninfected Godmaster content Fluke Hermit, they do not seem to have any other purpose other than to reproduce and grow. They also understand the concept of family. Their mother, Flukemarm, cannot move from her cave below the waterways and keeps breeding more and more Flukes. The Infection also made her noticeably angrier, enough to scare away the Godmaster content Fluke Hermit.

        Flukes usually wander the waterways looking for anything to eat. Godmaster content The Fluke Hermit, however, lives aside with some younger Flukes in the Godmaster content Junk Pit. She is also the only Fluke encountered by the Knight with whom they can communicate.
